# Long Run Growth Theories

## Introduction

There is much interest in the drivers and the determinants of long-run economic development. Theories of proposed, which are simplifications of the real world, and to validate these theories, economists create measurements that relate models to the real world.

To make measurements, one requires units of measurement that are stable over time. For economics, money seems like a sensible choice for this unit, facilitating aggregation and allows for compatibility. Unfortunately, money is not a stable unit of account over time. This is due to __inflation__ and the __different currencies__ that countries use.

### Introducing GDP

GDP measures the total goods and services produced in country over a particular time period, usually a year. Intermediate production is excluded, to avoid double counting. It measures the welfare of the average person in this country, derived from consumption of goods an services plus future consumption utility current investment goods will
eventually generate in the future - it is important to remember that it omits everything else. 

The fundamental accounting identity which governs GDP can be written:

$$ Y_t = C_t + I_t + G_t + \underbrace{(X_t - M_t)}_{\text{Net Exports}}$$

where $Y_t$ is GDP, $C_t$ is private consumption, this includes durable and non-durable goods and services, $I_t$ is private investment which includes structures, machinery & equipment, and software which is bought or produced by firms. $G_t$ is government expenditures and $(X_t - M_t)$ are net exports, that is, exports ($X_t$) minus imports ($M_t$).

### Economic Growth

Economic growth is the increase in real GDP, however we measure GDP in nominal terms, which includes inflation. In order to calculate real GDP, a price index - or deflator - is used for each item. The growth rate for an item can be written:

$$ \frac{\Delta x}{x} = \frac{\Delta X}{X} - \frac{\Delta p}{p} $$
where $\frac{\Delta x}{x}$ is the real growth rate, $\frac{\Delta X}{X}$ is nominal growth and \frac{\Delta p}{p} is the item's inflation.

The growth of GDP is an average of these growth rates, weighted by their relative shares in GDP. In practice, the process involves measuring chained quantity indexes {cite:p}`ONSQMI`.


### The Kaldor Facts

In 1957, Nicholas Kaldor summarized the main properties of long run growth {cite:p}`Kaldor1961`:

1. GDP grows at a roughly constant rate.

2. The capital to GDP rate is roughly constant.

3. Capital and labour shares are roughly constant across time.

4. The rate of return on investment is roughly constant.

5. The real wages grows at a roughly constant rate

For any theory of long run economic growth to be plausible, they must adhere to these stylized facts.
