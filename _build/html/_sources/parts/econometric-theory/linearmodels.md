# The Linear Regression Model

The linear regression model concerns itself with modelling a multivariate linear relationship between an endogenous (or dependent) variable which is denotes as $y_t$, and a number of exogenous (or explanatory) variables, denoted $x_{ti}$, observed across $t = 1, 2, ... , T$. In a model with $k$ exogenous variables, the liner regression model is specified:

$$ y_t = \beta_1 x_{t1} + \beta_2 x_{t2} + ... + \beta_{k} x_{tk}$$

Typically, econometricians add a constant term, setting $x_{t1} = 1$ for all $t$, such that the specification can be written:

$$ y_t = \beta_1 + \beta_2 x_{t2} + ... + \beta_{k} x_{tk}$$
