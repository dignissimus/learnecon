## Limitations of MMT

So there are some important paradigms that MMT draws on. Part of the problem is that this is an advanced undergraduate level of economics. As such, many casual observers have a hard time understanding credit creation and how fiscal-monetary independence works. One of the primary reasons people buy into MMT is a lack of a clear understanding of the money creation process. To some, it may even seem like a 'free lunch'. However - in reality - this is not the case.

The central bank does not physically print money; they do not even control the money supply; they are mostly there to provide liquidity to banks meaning they create credit but not "literal money." In contrast, the federal government borrows money by auctioning bonds several times a week in a public-facing auction. This public-facing auction is really important because it allows the market to value the US debt. The Federal Reserve even has to buy bonds at the same auction. There is no special arrangement between the treasury and the central bank. The Bank of England provides a very comprehensive overview of the money creation process {cite:p}`Stevens2021`.

A crucial pillar of modern macroeconomics is that individuals form and consider expectations of future outcomes. For example, individuals will form an expectation of the inflation rate tomorrow, based on what they know today. To illustrate this, consider a government that abuses its monetary system by forcing the central bank to finance its activities with money creation. The citizens lose faith in their system, causing volatile inflation expectations that may spiral out of control towards hyperinflation. Once people have lost faith in a currency or central bank, it is not easy to recover, although Brazil has managed to pull itself out of this nosedive in a very interesting case study.

Robert Lucas developed, in part, these rational expectations ideas and have since become a linchpin of modern macroeconomics. Lucas argued that consumers are intelligent strategists that act and make decisions rationally. People think strategically, and in order to have economically meaningful models, we have to account for strategic human behaviour at the microeconomic scale, not just the macroeconomic one. He developed this theory by observing a correlation between high inflation and high unemployment, which shattered the macroeconomist's ideas about a Philips curve (the Philips curve represents an inflation-unemployment tradeoff). 

This theory is called the rational expectations hypothesis: consumers expect future inflation to be high, affecting current outcomes and subsequent behaviours. For these reasons, no macroeconomists or central bankers of merit would scoff at central bank independence: signalling to consumers that the central bank will always act against high or rising inflation is important to creating a positive climate for investments.
